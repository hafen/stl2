\title{Seasonal Diagnostic Plot for an stl3 Object}
\description{
Plots each cycle-subseries of the detrended data (or equivalently, 
seasonal plus remainder), with the mean subtracted.  The fitted seasonal 
component is plotted as a line through the points.
}
\usage{
plot.seasonal(x, col = c("black", "red"), lwd = 2, xlab = "Time", 
    ylab = "Centered Seasonal + Remainder", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{object of class \code{"stl3"}.}
  \item{col, lwd, xlab, ylab, ...}{parameters to be passed to \code{xyplot()}.}
}
\details{
Helps decide how much of the variation in the data other than the trend should go into the seasonal component, and how much in the remainder.
}
\value{
object of class \code{"trellis"}.
